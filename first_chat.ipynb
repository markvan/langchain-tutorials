      "\n",
      "3. **Transforming and binning values**: You can also transform the data to reduce the impact of outliers, using methods like logarithms or square roots, for instance. This can often help in achieving a more normal distribution. Another similar method is to create bins for your data and count how many points fall into each bin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Imputing**: Similar to missing values, you can also impute the outliers. You can use methods like mean, median, and mode imputation, or use more complex ones, like k-nearest neighbors or MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations).  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Use models resistant to outliers**: Some models are more resistant to outliers than others. For example, tree-based models are not usually affected by outliers, while linear regression is quite sensitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, outliers are not always bad. Sometimes they can indicate something important or provide valuable information, so don't just blindly remove them. Always try to understand why they exist and what they represent before deciding how to handle them.\n"
